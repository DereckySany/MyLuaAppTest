It's ***Work In Progress***.The project is still in the **alpha** stage, and most of the Features are **not implemented** (such as build module). At present, this project can not be fully run.

MyLuaApp is a light and faster software run in **Android Arm Devices** to develop Android software that combines **Lua and Java**.

You can use lua to develop Android software!The project use [AndroLua_pro](https://github.com/nirenr/AndroLua_pro) runtime environment of the software, run much faster than the original [AndroLua](https://github.com/mkottman/AndroLua)

If you've never used Lua before, that's fine. You can still use Java to develop software, which support java or mixed of Lua and Java to develop, but there is no support plan for ndk for the time being.

This project used Lua to parse the project configuration script. Based on the flexibility of lua, it may even be possible to dynamically add packaging tasks to the build system in the future.
